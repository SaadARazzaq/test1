<h3 id="my-contribution-email-functionality-with-otp-verification">My Contribution: Email Functionality with OTP Verification</h3>
<p>As part of the development team, I was responsible for implementing the <strong>email functionality</strong> in the eCommerce application. This feature ensures that users can securely register and verify their accounts using a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their email address. Below is an overview of my work on this feature:</p>
<h4 id="key-responsibilities-">Key Responsibilities:</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>OTP Generation and Email Sending</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a mechanism to generate a unique OTP for each user during the registration process.</li>
<li>Integrated Django&#39;s email backend to send the OTP to the user&#39;s registered email address.</li>
<li>Used Python&#39;s <code>random</code> module to generate a 6-digit OTP, ensuring it is unique and time-sensitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Email Template Design</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed a user-friendly email template using HTML and CSS to ensure the OTP email is visually appealing and easy to read.</li>
<li>Included clear instructions for the user to enter the OTP on the website to complete the verification process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>OTP Verification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a backend API endpoint to validate the OTP entered by the user.</li>
<li>Implemented a time-based expiration for the OTP (e.g., 5 minutes) to enhance security.</li>
<li>Stored the OTP securely in the database using Django&#39;s built-in models and ensured it is deleted after successful verification or expiration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Error Handling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added robust error handling to manage cases such as incorrect OTP entries, expired OTPs, and email delivery failures.</li>
<li>Provided meaningful error messages to the user to guide them through the verification process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Testing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducted unit tests to ensure the OTP generation, email sending, and verification processes work as expected.</li>
<li>Performed integration testing to verify the seamless flow between the frontend and backend components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="challenges-and-solutions-">Challenges and Solutions:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Ensuring the OTP is delivered promptly to the user&#39;s email.<br><strong>Solution</strong>: Configured Django&#39;s email backend with a reliable SMTP service (e.g., Gmail SMTP) to ensure timely delivery.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Preventing OTP misuse or brute-force attacks.<br><strong>Solution</strong>: Implemented rate-limiting on the OTP verification endpoint and added a maximum retry limit for OTP entries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="outcome-">Outcome:</h4>
<p>The email functionality with OTP verification was successfully implemented and integrated into the eCommerce application. This feature enhances the security of the registration process, ensuring that only verified users can access the platform. The user feedback during testing was positive, with users appreciating the simplicity and security of the OTP-based verification process.</p>
<p>This contribution aligns with the project&#39;s goal of creating a secure and user-friendly eCommerce platform. It also demonstrates my ability to work on critical backend features and deliver them within the project timeline.</p>
